A brandâ€™s sales is impacted by multiple factors.  The internal controllable factors include HCP and Consumer Targets and corresponding Promotions   Formulary Positions etc. . The external non controllable factors include Brand Efficacy & Prescribing Information   Competition etc. 
Currently, we study and model the impacts of such factors on resulting sales independently by respective teams of experts.  The interactions are not completely captured. 
In reality, these factors depend on each other and a complex interaction among them defines the market environment and the resulting sales. 
A clear opportunity exists in estimating sales impact by these factors and, more importantly, the interactions between them.  This will help in developing effective marketing strategies.
